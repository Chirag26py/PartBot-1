# Contributing

As a general rule of thumb:

* Pull Requests that fix existing bugs and completely address them are greatly welcomed.
* Pull Requests that fix explicit grammatical errors are welcome, but not encouraged.
* Pull Requests that add a feature will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
* Pull Requests that change a correct wording, add unnecessary words, or otherwise do not improve the repository in any way will immediately be flagged as spam.


Please test your changes before making a pull request, and try to stick to general code syntax. While I haven't ensured that the code is lintable, I have tried to maintain some standards while writing code. You're free to use any respectable writing style, though I might suggest edits to stick to the standard style used.
