				<h1>The Quest for Atlantis</h1>
				Hello, fellow HydroCitizens! As you may have noticed, we've been discussing a rather important discovery over the past few days. On the 5th of November, seas all over the simulator were shaken by the rising of something. No one knew what had risen; all we knew that it was something monumentous. A week later, another quake rocked the seas - and since our scanners were on high alert, we managed to pinpoint the final location. The probes that we sent to investigate have finally returned - and they bring tidings of a long-lost underwater city.
				<br />
				<br />
				<small>(No, nerds, HydroCity isn't lost)</small>
				<br />
				<br />
				In order to investigate, we're deploying teams to check out the situation. The location in concern is a large, underwater volcano known as Lavolt. However, our probes confirmed that there are tunnels in the volcano that lead to air-filled pockets, with a myriad of tunnels. Based on the location of the bubble, we're presuming that the lost city of Atlantis has been found! (The nice marble statue of Hydro with the inscription 'Atlantis' also helped.)
				<br />
				<br />
				However, the tunnels seem... aware. And they don't seem intent on letting our probes progress - they simply stumble into puzzles and are unable to proceed. For this, we need some brave teams of explorers to help us out!
				<br />
				<br />
				Of course, your services will not be requested for free. We are also offering the following to our explorers!
				<br />
				<br />
				Every explorer on the first team to reach Atlantis will receive 200 Droplets and 3 Water Cookies. Similarly, explorers on the second and third teams to reach Atlantis will receive 150 / 100 Droplets and 2/1 Water Cookie(s) respectively. Explorers on the fourth and fifth teams will get 75 Droplets, too.
				<br />
				<br />
				In addition to the above, all explorers will be awarded 100 Droplets on reaching Atlantis, and will also get 50 more Droplets and a Water Cookie if they complete all puzzles. Furthermore, every explorer that participates will get 50 Droplets, and solving any puzzles will net the whole team a Water Cookie each.
				<br />
				<br />
				The tunnels also place a heavy restriction on team size - they can only accomodate exploration teams that are either solo or up to 3 members. We look forward to seeing many, many teams register!
				<br />
				<br />
				Our submarines will be ready to depart on the 24th of November, at exactly 0500 GMT. We wish you the best!
