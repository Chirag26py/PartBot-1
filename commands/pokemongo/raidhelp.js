Simply type <code>,register</code> in chat and fill in the form with your info. You can always change your info later by filling in the form again.</p><hr/></details>\n<details><summary><span style="font-size:1.17em;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;font-weight:bold;display:inline-flex;" id="raid-list">Raid List</span></summary>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve registered, you can set up your own raid list. Whenever someone hosts a raid for a Pokemon on your list, you&#39;ll receive a notification. There&#39;s four commands you can use for this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>,addraids (Pokemon 1), (Pokemon 2), ...</code> - Adds the specified Pokemon to your raid list (up to 10).</li>\n<li><code>,removeraids (Pokemon 1), (Pokemon 2), ...</code> - Removes the specified Pokemon from your raid list.</li>\n<li><code>,myraids</code> - Shows you your current raid list.</li>\n<li><code>,setraids (Pokemon 1), (Pokemon 2), ...</code> - Overwrites your current list to the list you specify.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also prefix <strong>WB</strong> to a Pokemon name (eg:- WB Mewtwo) to only be pinged when the hosted Pokemon is weather-boosted.</p><hr/></details>\n<details><summary><span style="font-size:1.17em;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;font-weight:bold;display:inline-flex;" id="joining-a-raid">Joining a Raid</span></summary>\n<p>To join/leave a raid, simply click the <code>Join</code> and <code>Leave</code> buttons on the raid menu. Only join a raid if you have a Remote Raid Pass. To view a list of all ongoing raids, you can use <code>,raids</code>.\nOnce you&#39;ve joined, you&#39;ll be shown the host&#39;s friend code. Open the app and add the host as a friend, and wait. When the host is ready, they&#39;ll ping all users in the raid and wait for confirmation - when you get the ping, make sure to mention that you&#39;re ready and open the app. Once everyone is ready, the host will join the raid and send invites, where they&#39;ll ping everyone again - at this point, join the raid!</p><hr/></details>\n<details><summary><span style="font-size:1.17em;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;font-weight:bold;display:inline-flex;" id="hosting">Hosting</span></summary>\n<p>When you&#39;re ready to host a raid, follow the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use <code>,hostraid (Pokemon name), (current weather), (free slots), (time left)</code> - This command creates a raid with you as the host. Please do not host if there&#39;s less than 5 minutes left on the raid. Eg:- <code>,hostraid Mewtwo, Windy, 5 slots, 35 minutes</code> would host a weather-boosted Mewtwo raid with five free slots.</li>\n<li>Wait for people to join. Make sure to only host once you have enough people - don&#39;t go in on a Lugia with 4 people and end up losing all your passes.</li>\n<li>Once you have enough people (including confirming their friend requests!), use the <code>,pingraid</code> command to ping all the users in your raid. Open the app and wait for most users to confirm their presence, then join the raid and send invites. When you&#39;ve sent the invites, use the <code>,pingraid</code> command again to let everyone know that you&#39;ve sent out invites.</li>\n<li>Fight in the raid! If you end up winning, make sure to do <code>,endraid</code> once you&#39;re wrapped up. Otherwise, if you lost, try to get some more people and try again (you don&#39;t need another pass to retry a raid if it&#39;s still active).</li>\n</ol><hr/></details>\n<details><summary><span style="font-size:1.17em;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;font-weight:bold;display:inline-flex;" id="good-practices">Good Practices</span></summary>\n<ul>\n<li>(Player) When you&#39;re waiting for the host&#39;s invite, open the Friends menu and keep opening/closing it. This forces the app to refresh your raid invites so that you don&#39;t end up missing the raid!</li>\n<li>Consult the optimal raid counters before the raid, and plan your team accordingly.</li>\n<li>(Host) Nickname all the players that you plan on inviting with the same 3/4-letter code. This way, you can type that code when you&#39;re inviting, saving you precious seconds and making it easier for people to join on time.</li>\n<li>(Host) Make sure to invite when there&#39;s at least 6-7 minutes left, so that people don&#39;t miss out on the raid boss if they accidentally disconnect after the raid.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t bring Aggron.</li>\n</ul><hr/></details></div>`;
